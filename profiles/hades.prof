  The brother of Zeus and ruler of the underworld, Hades is resentful
  of his appointment as lord of the dead by Zeus, as he is forced to
  watch over the souls of those deceased. He plans to release the Titans
  sealed long ago by Zeus and take over Mount Olympus. Hercules stands
  in his way, however, so he tries to kill off Hercules by making him
  mortal, but fails to remove Hercules’ god-like strength. Hades begins
  searching for Hercules’ weak point so that he can carry out his plan
  to overthrow Zeus.
