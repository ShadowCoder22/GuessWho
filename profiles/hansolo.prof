  Born on Corellia, Han would give up his life in the imperial academy
  to save the wookie Chewbacca from being beaten. With his new companion,
  Han would later get mixed up with the rebel alliance and fall in love with
  Princess Leia Organa with whom he would father three children as force
  sensitive as their grandfather and uncle, Anakin and Luke Skywalker.
