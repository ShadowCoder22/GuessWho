  Son of Zeus, Hercules has immense physical power, along with the
  courage to back it up. He is the only one who can defeat the Titans and
  stop Hades’ plan, so Hades attempts to kill him by making him mortal.
  Hercules survives and retains his strength, but has to prove he is a
  true hero to be able to return to Mount Olympus. During his trials he
  meets Megara, with whom he falls in love. Hercules would do anything to
  protect her, which becomes his only weakness, but also his greatest
  triumph.
