  The scheming Grand Vizier to the sultan of Agrabah. Jafar seeks the
  greatest treasure: a magical lamp containing a genie that can grant any
  three wishes the finder desires. Using Aladdin as his pawn, he nearly
  obtains the lamp but fails when Abu steals it from him. He expects to be
  exiled after Jasmine marries, but fidns out that Aladdin has the lamp and 
  succeeds in stealing it back. Jafar quickly uses two wishes, and in a 
  sudden increase for his thirst for power he uses his third, which was a
  trick by Aladdin. Jafar’s last wish proved to be his downfall.
