  Jasmine is the daughter of the Sultan of Agrabah. She detests the
  fact that she must have an arranged marriage to a prince by the time she
  comes of age. She longs to be free from the prison that is the palace,
  where she has lived her whole life and never left once. Jasmine finally
  decides to leave the palace, and sneaks away one night to secure her
  freedom. She meets Aladdin in the marketplace, who also longs for freedom
  like Jasmine but soon becomes the target of Jafar’s schemes.
