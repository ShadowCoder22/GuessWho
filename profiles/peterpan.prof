  This young man is a common character in children’s stories that fantasize
  dreams and never-ending fun. One day, Wendy and her siblings meet Peter Pan
  when he comes back looking for his shadow that he lost. He takes them to
  Neverland, a fantasy land where Indians, pirates, and mermaids abound. Peter
  intends for Wendy to be a mother figure for the other orphans there but is 
  pursued by Captain Hook, who wants revenge against Pan for the loss of his 
  hand. Hook almost succeeds but Peter reconciles with Tinkerbell, who manages
  to save his life.  Peter wants Wendy to stay in Neverland but they decide to
  return home.
