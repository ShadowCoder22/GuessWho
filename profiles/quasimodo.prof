  Born physically deformed but with a kind heart, Quasimodo attends to
  the bells of Notre Dame in Paris. While he is assured by Frollo that the
  people would revile him, he nonetheless longs to live outside of the
  cathedral, if even for a day. He comes to care deeply for the gypsy Esmeralda,
  up to the point that he realizes that Frollo never really cared for him at
  all, and defies Frollo. Quasimodo saves Esmeralda from Frollo’s rage before 
  she is burned at the stake, and protects her from Frollo’s rampage.
