  The Queen is Snow White’s self-obsessed stepmother. She constantly asks
  magic mirror who the fairest in the land is, and takes delight when the
  answer is always herself. When the mirror one day says Snow White is the
  fairest, she jealously attempts to have Snow White murdered. When her plan
  fails she takes matters into her own hands, using magic to conceal herself
  and attempts to kill Snow White, who is under the protection of the dwarves.
