  Jedi Master Shaak Ti was a Togruta Jedi who was one of the last
  members of the Jedi Council. Shaak Ti was involved in many conflicts
  throughout the clone wars. She was regarded with the highest respect
  and revered by all Jedi. She was later confronted by Vader's secret
  apprentice on Felucia and, conceding her own defeat, flung herself
  into the Ancient Abyss.
