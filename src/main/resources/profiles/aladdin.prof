  This street smart thief roams about the markets of Agrabah,
  stealing food to help him and his pet monkey Abu survive from day
  to day. He never steals more than he needs, however, and often
  gives food to poor street urchins in even more need than him. He
  falls in love with the Princess Jasmine and seeks a way to win her
  love, enlisting the aid of the Genie and fighting Jafar’s power-
  hungry intentions.
