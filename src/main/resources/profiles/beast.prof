  Once a spoiled and selfish prince, Beast now spends his days
  residing within his enchanted castle. Due to his lack of love in the
  past, an enchantress changed him to his beastly form and cursed him
  to stay a beast forever if he does not find true love. He imprisons
  Belle’s father but later imprisons Belle in his place. While Beast
  sees Belle as an opportunity to free himself from the curse, he must
  overcome his own temper and pride to find love within his heart.
