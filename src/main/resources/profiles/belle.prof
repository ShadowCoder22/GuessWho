  The beautiful yet bookish Belle is seen as a bit odd and strange
  by the rest of the people in her provincial town. She spends much
  of her time reading books and helping her inventor father Maurice,
  much to the chagrin of the brute Gaston, who wants Belle to marry him.
  Belle is forced into the Beast’s castle as a prisoner trying to save
  her father, and while at first she thinks the Beast is a terrible
  being, she later comes to see the softer side he possesses.
