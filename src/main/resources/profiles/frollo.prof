  Frollo is a high ranking judge serving in Paris. He despises
  gypsies and other outcasts, believing them to be insects in need of
  squashing. He kills a gypsy woman during a crackdown and intends to
  kill her baby, but is stopped by a priest, who points out his sin.
  Although he detests it, he is forced to raise the deformed baby, whom
  he names Quasimodo out of scorn. He lusts after the beautiful gypsy
  dancer Esmeralda, although he continually believes that he is the most
  righteous and pure man before God in all of Paris.
