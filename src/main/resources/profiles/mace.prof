  Considered one of the greatest Jedi in history, Mace Windu served
  on the Jedi Order his entire life and was said to be rivaled only by
  Master Yoda and Count Dooku. Mace served on the front lines of the
  clone wars with distinction but was unfortunately brought down by the
  betrayal of Anakin Skywalker and subsequently murdered by the sith lord
  Sidious.
