  An evil fairy, Maleficent holds a grudge against King Stefan and the
  queen for not inviting her to the celebration of Princess Aurora’s birth.
  Because of this, she curses Aurora to prick her finger on a spindle of a
  spinning wheel and die before her sixteenth birthday. Though her curse is
  weakened, she persists in carrying out her sinister plot, and attempts to
  imprison Prince Philip to ensure that Aurora will never wake from her
  eternal slumber.
