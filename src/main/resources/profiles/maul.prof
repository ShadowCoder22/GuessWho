  This Zabrak sith lord was trained from an early age by the evil lord
  Sidious. During the cirsis on Naboo, Darth  Maul was commissioned to find
  Queen Amidala and return her to Naboo. He confronted Jedi Master Qui-Gon
  Jin on Tatooine where the Queen was able to escape. Later, on Naboo, Maul
  again confronted Qui-Gon and killed him but was killed by Obi-Wan.
