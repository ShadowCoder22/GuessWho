  Formerly the apprentice to Qui-Gon Jin, Obi-Wan played a pivotal role
  in the fate of the galaxy. Though this Jedi is responsible for the deaths
  of both General Grievous and Darth Maul, his training of Anakin Skywalker
  and later Luke Skywalker, threw the galaxy first into chaos and then into
  balance. He manages to remain loyal to the republic even after the Jedi
  are betrayed by Anakin.
