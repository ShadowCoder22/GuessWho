  Pocahontas belongs to an Indian tribe that first meets the English
  explorers when they set out upon the new continent. She meets John Smith
  early during their colonization, and teaches him that her people are not
  savages, and that the English settlers should treat the land with respect.
  Despite her assuring Smith that the lands had no gold, the other English
  settlers prepare to attack the Indian tribes. Pocahontas intervenes at the
  last moment, saving John Smith and preventing much bloodshed.
