  Scar is Mufasa’s jealous and power-hungry brother who wants the throne
  for himself. He attempts to kill off Simba by luring him into the elephant
  graveyard but fails when Mufasa appears to save his son. After rallying
  the hyenas, Scar lures Simba into a gorge and starts a wildebeest stampede.
  Mufasa manages to save Simba, but Scar secretly murders Mufasa and blames
  the ordeal on Simba, who he exiles from the kingdom. Scar becomes king and
  lets the Pride Lands descend into wasteland, but Simba returns eventually
  to take back his rightful place on the throne.
