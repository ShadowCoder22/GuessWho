  Simba is the son of Mufasa who is eager to become king but 
  still naïve about what it means to be a king. After the death
  of his father, he blames himself for it, although it was Mufasa’s
  envious brother Scar who was actually responsible. Exiled by
  Scar, Simba meets Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him the ideology
  of Hakuna Matata and no worries, and he matures with this view
  stuck in his mind. However, his childhood friend Nala appears,
  and reminds him, along with the help of Rafiki, that only he can
  take his father’s place as king and restore balance to the Circle
  of Life.
