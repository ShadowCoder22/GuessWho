  Ursula is a sea witch living on the outskirts of King
  Triton’s lands. For reasons unknown she holds a grudge against
  him, and when Ariel comes to her looking for help, she hatches
  a plan to finally exact her revenge on Triton. She tricks Ariel
  and other mermaids before her into horrible contracts that often
  leave the victims subjugate to Ursula’s whims. When Ariel nearly
  succeeds in fulfilling the terms of her contract, Ursula goes
  up to the human world personally to make sure that Ariel will
  fail, and Triton will suffer.
